# Fulcrum
**Fulcrum is a proof-of-concept remote access and monitoring tool for Windows, demonstrating how Discord's bot framework can be used to remotely access systems. It is using a Discord server as a command and control (C2) server, allowing you to control infected machines from any device via Discord, while avoiding detection by using Discord's infrastructure. This approach is effective and potentially exploitable because Discord supports complex server structures that can host text channels and files. Discord bots can create and interact with text channels, allowing scalability. Additionally, Discord's bot framework allows multiple systems to connect to the C2 server through the same bot simultaneously, which allows control over an unlimited number of systems. Each system runs the same bot using the same token. A malicious actor could run a small botnet through Discord without needing any sophisticated infrastructure. This tool is for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and with explicit authorization.**

**Remote access trojans like these are already used by criminals.**

 **If you want to install Fulcrum on a computer you have physical access to, try the [Fulcrum Bad Usb Installer Device](https://github.com/MaximDieball/Fulcrum-Bad-Usb-Installer-Device).**


### Setup
- Create your own Discord bot at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Set up a Discord server with the following structure

- Invite your bot to the server.
- Run the ``token_and_key_gen.py`` and enter your discord bot token.
    - There should be two new files in the directory called ``.env`` and ``key.key``.
    - Upload both files to the ``your-files`` channel.
- Copy the download link of the ``key.key`` file and add it to the code of the ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` file at `DECRYPTION_KEY_URL = "YOUR URL"`
- Upload the ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` file to the ``your-files`` channel.
  - You can rename ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` if you want to.
  - If you want to use a compiled version of ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` you will need Discord nitro to upload the file due to its size.
- Copy the download link of the ``.env`` file and add it to the code of the ``installer.py`` file at ``DOT_ENV_FILE_URL = "YOUR URL"``
- Copy the download link of the ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw``(or your renamed file) file and add it to the code of the ``installer.py`` file at ``BEACON_URL = "YOUR URL"``  

  
### Infecting a System
- Execute the ``installer.py`` file on the victim's computer.
  - remember to add your URLs to ``installer.py`` before.
- The Fulcrum beacon will be downloaded and execute.
- A new discord channel will appear on your discord server.
  - ``[pc name]-[hardware id]``
- The beacon adds a .lnk file to the Startup folder and will reconnect after the system is turned off and on again.
  - ``[pc name] logged on``

- You can now use any command through the created channel or the `all-channel` channel.

### Current Commands
- ``-TP [x]``: Takes a picture via a connected device. You can pass the identifier number to the command. If not, it will use 0.
- ``-SG [x]``: Takes a screen grab. You can pass a number for a specific screen. If not, it will take one picture of all screens.
- ``-SHELL``: Starts a remote shell controlled by the text channel. Any message that is typed will be sent as a command to the CMD, and the beacon will respond with the CMD prompt's response.
  - ``quit``: Ends and terminates the shell.
- ``-RC [command]`` Run a single cmd command.
- ``-KL``: Starts a key logger, logging every key pressed.
  - ``-UHK``: Stops and unhooks the keylogger.
  - ``-GLK``: Gets logged keys and sends them into the channel.
- ``-UF {message_attachment: file}``: Uploads a file on the infected computer.
- ``-MB {message}``: Create a message box that contains a custom message.

### Planned Features
- **Triggers** that will activate the keylogger when certain events happen on the computer.
- **File Downloader** A download command that sends a file from the system into the discord channel -GF [path]
- **Internet History Log**
- **Clipboard monitoring**


### Known bugs
- Keylogger not stopping after ``-UHK`` command.
