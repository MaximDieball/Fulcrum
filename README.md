# Fulcrum
**Fulcrum is a remote monitoring and access tool designed for educational purposes, providing insights into the operation of command and control (C2) servers via Discord. Please use this software responsibly. Unauthorized use without explicit permission is strictly prohibited.**
 **Check out the supported commands below â†“**


### Setup
- Create your own Discord bot at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- Set up a Discord server with the following structure

- Invite your bot to the server.
- Run the ``token_and_key_gen.py`` and enter your discord bot token.
    - There should be two new files in the directory called ``.env`` and ``key.key``.
    - Upload both files to the ``your-files`` channel.
- Copy the download link of the ``key.key`` file and add it to the code of the ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` file at `DECRYPTION_KEY_URL = "YOUR URL"`
- Upload the ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` file to the ``your-files`` channel.
  - You can rename ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` if you want to.
  - If you want to use a compiled version of ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw`` you will need Discord nitro to upload the file due to its size.
- Copy the download link of the ``.env`` file and add it to the code of the ``installer.py`` file at ``DOT_ENV_FILE_URL = "YOUR URL"``
- Copy the download link of the ``fulcrum_beacon.pyw``(or your renamed file) file and add it to the code of the ``installer.py`` file at ``BEACON_URL = "YOUR URL"``

### Infecting a System
- Execute the ``installer.py`` file on the victim's computer.
  - remember to add your URLs to ``installer.py`` before.
- The Fulcrum beacon will be downloaded and execute.
- A new discord channel will appear on your discord server.
  - ``[pc name]-[hardware id]``
- The beacon adds a .lnk file to the Startup folder and will reconnect after the system is turned off and on again.
  - ``[pc name] logged on``

- You can now use any command through the created channel or the `all-channel` channel.

### Current Commands
- ``-TP [x]``: Takes a picture via a connected device. You can pass the identifier number to the command. If not, it will use 0.
- ``-SG [x]``: Takes a screen grab. You can pass a number for a specific screen. If not, it will take one picture of all screens.
- ``-SHELL``: Starts a remote shell controlled by the text channel. Any message that is typed will be sent as a command to the CMD, and the beacon will respond with the CMD prompt's response.
  - ``quit``: Ends and terminates the shell.
- ``-RC [command]`` Run a single cmd command.
- ``-KL``: Starts a key logger, logging every key pressed.
  - ``-UHK``: Stops and unhooks the keylogger.
  - ``-GLK``: Gets logged keys and sends them into the channel.
- ``-UF {message_attachment: file}``: Uploads a file on the infected computer.
- ``-MB {message}``: Create a message box that contains a custom message.
